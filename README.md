# Overview of the statistical analysis
To start a new business, the existing business analysis is important.  To create a proposal for a bike-sharing program in a new city, we explored the existing New York city bike-share program analysis. Luckily the data has been released to the public, so the data analysis began using the Visualization tool Tableau.  The record showed a total of 1,344,224 trips made in Aug 2019.  Using visuals we were able to create maps, charts, and heat maps, focusing on Short term customers vs. Annual Subscribed customers, genders, and most used hours or weekdays.  The result reported were the following.


## Results:
#### Individual charts are created to help viewers to understand the actual data from the existing business and those individual analysis is listed here.
